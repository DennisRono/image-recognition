# Literature Review (2024–2025)

### Vision

* **SAM 2.0:** Meta’s Segment Anything Model 2.0 (2024) is a promptable image/video segmentation model built on transformers with streaming memory and a large video segmentation dataset. SAM 2.0 achieves higher accuracy with fewer user inputs than the original SAM, and is reportedly 6× faster on image segmentation.
* **DINOv2:** A self-supervised vision foundation model (Meta AI, 2024) that trains ViT models (up to 1B parameters) on a curated web image dataset (142M images). DINOv2 produces “all-purpose” robust image and pixel features that outperform prior models: its distilled smaller models surpass OpenCLIP on most image and pixel benchmarks. It yields state-of-art results on tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation without labels.
* **EVA-02:** An open Vision Transformer (Baidu Research, 2024) pre-trained via masked image modeling using CLIP vision-encoder tokens as targets. EVA-02 (304M params) reaches 90.0% top-1 fine-tune accuracy on ImageNet-1K and 80.4% zero-shot with a CLIP variant, outperforming prior open CLIP-sized models with much less data/compute. The EVA-02 family (6M–304M) showcases efficient training and strong vision-LM alignment.
* **SigLIP 2:** DeepMind’s SigLIP 2 (Feb 2025) is a family of multilingual contrastive image-text encoders (ViT sizes 86M–1B). It augments CLIP-style training with captioning losses, self-distillation, and better data curation. Compared to original SigLIP, SigLIP 2 consistently boosts zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and especially localization/dense prediction. The best SigLIP 2 models exceed prior open VLMs on cross-modal tasks and support many languages.
* **CLIP Variants:** OpenAI’s CLIP (2021) and open-source reproductions (OpenCLIP, LiT, XCLIP) remain foundational for vision-language. Recent works often use CLIP encoders (e.g. EVA-02-CLIP) or large vision models as image encoders. OpenCLIP provides weights for ViT and ResNet backbones. Key advances are in larger vision backbones (ViT-giga, etc.) and improved training data. (For example, EVA-02’s CLIP variant surpasses previous best open CLIP by a wide margin.)

### Language

* **LLaMA 2/3:** Meta’s LLaMA series (2023–2024) offers open LLMs at 8B, 70B, and up to 405B parameters. LLaMA 3.1 405B (2024) was released with 15T pre-training tokens and a huge 128K token context window. These open models support 8 languages and include tools (search, math, code execution). Their benchmark scores approach or even surpass GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, making them the largest open models.
* **Mistral:** Mistral AI’s LLMs (France, 2024) include the Mixtral Mixture-of-Experts series (Mixtral-8x7B) and the dense Mistral Large 2 (123B). Mistral Large 2 (July 2024) shows exceptional code and math performance: it scores \~84.0% on MMLU (rivaling Llama3-405B) and 92.0% on HumanEval (state-of-art for open models). Trained with heavy code data, it “vastly outperforms” its predecessor. It remains open-access under a research license.
* **Gemma:** Google’s Gemma models (2025) are lightweight open LLMs (1B, 4B, 12B, 27B) built on Gemini 2.0 tech. Gemma 3 (Mar 2025) is optimized for single-GPU/TPU use: the 27B model achieves state-of-art “for its size,” even outperforming much larger models (e.g. Llama3-405B) in human evals. It supports an expanded 128K token context and **140+ languages**, with vision & video reasoning capabilities. Official quantized versions further accelerate inference.
* **Phi-3:** Microsoft’s Phi-3 family (2024) introduced “small” LLMs (3.8B, 7B, 14B). Phi-3-mini (3.8B) was launched in Apr 2024 and reportedly “outperforms models twice its size” across language, coding, and math benchmarks. Larger variants (7B, 14B) soon followed. These SLMs focus on efficiency: they offer high performance on standard tasks (MMLU, HumanEval, etc.) with far lower compute. Phi-3 is fully open (via Azure/Hugging Face) and intended for on-device or edge use.

### Multimodal

* **InternVL 2.5:** OpenGVLab’s InternVL (Dec 2024) is an open-source Multimodal LLM (MLLM) series (1B–78B params) trained with innovative *Mixed Preference Optimization* (MPO) on image+text tasks. The flagship InternVL2.5-78B becomes *the first open MLLM to exceed 70% accuracy on the Multimodal MMLU (MMMU) benchmark*, matching closed-model GPT-4o. InternVL2.5 also outperforms earlier InternVL models by \~2 points on vision-language tasks, and competes with top closed models on a range of vision+language benchmarks.
* **GPT-4V Successors (GPT-4o):** OpenAI’s GPT-4 introduced vision, and in May 2024 they released GPT-4o (“omni”). GPT-4o unifies text, image, and audio input/output in a single model, with a 128K context window. It operates in real-time (chat with images/audio) and sets new records in multilingual, audio, and vision benchmarks. GPT-4o significantly improves non-English understanding and audio recognition/translation (ASR) over prior models, and its vision+voice capabilities are being integrated into ChatGPT (with voice-mode for plus users). This class of models exemplifies state-of-art multimodal fusion in a single LLM.
* **LLaVA-NeXT:** Stanford’s LLaVA-NeXT (2024) is an open LMM that “supercharges” multimodal ability by using very strong LLM backbones (e.g. LLaMA3-8B, Qwen-1.5-110B). The original LLaVA-NeXT (Yi-34B backbone) already surpassed Google’s Gemini-Pro on benchmarks like MMMU and MathVista. The expanded LLaVA-NeXT (with LLaMA3 and Qwen) further improves reasoning and OCR, achieving *state-of-the-art open-source performance* on vision-language reasoning. In head-to-head evals, LLaVA-NeXT “catches up to GPT4-V on selected benchmarks” while using far less compute. It retains a lightweight training recipe from prior LLaVA models.
* **Flamingo:** DeepMind’s Flamingo (2022) was an early VLM combining pretrained vision and language encoders via cross-attention. A single Flamingo model achieved few-shot state-of-art on open-ended image/video QA and captioning, outperforming models fine-tuned on 1000× more data. While Flamingo (and its open replicants like OpenFlamingo) is older, it remains a key architectural example of bridging vision and LLMs for flexible in-context multimodal learning.

### Audio

* **Whisper v3:** OpenAI’s Whisper (speech recognition) reached “Large v3” in Nov 2023. Whisper-v3 uses the same transformer architecture but improved training data filtering. It offers robust ASR across accents, noise, and many languages. For example, it supports high-quality transcription and translation for dozens of languages, benefiting from \~680k hours of refined audio data. (It supersedes Whisper-v2 from Dec 2022.)
* **MusicLM:** Google Research’s MusicLM (2023) is a text-to-music generator. It casts music synthesis as a hierarchical sequence modeling task, generating continuous 24kHz audio over several minutes. MusicLM significantly outperforms previous systems on audio fidelity and alignment to the text prompt. It can generate complex compositions (e.g. specific genres/instruments) and can transform a user-provided melody (whistle/hum) into fully produced music. The MusicCaps dataset (5.5k text-music pairs) was released with it.
* **AudioLM:** Google’s AudioLM (2022) treats raw audio generation with language-modeling techniques. It generates speech or piano music by chaining transformers over “semantic tokens” and “acoustic tokens.” AudioLM exhibits *long-term consistency* (keeping syntactic or melodic structure) and high fidelity. Human evaluation showed its speech continuations are virtually indistinguishable from real speech. AudioLM represents a state-of-art “audio language model,” pushing the frontier in audio synthesis.
* **Speech Synthesis (VALL-E 2):** Microsoft’s VALL-E 2 (late 2023) is a neural codec LLM for zero-shot TTS. It introduces techniques like *repetition-aware sampling* and *grouped code modeling* to improve stability and reduce sequence length. On LibriSpeech and VCTK benchmarks, VALL-E 2 surpasses previous zero-shot TTS systems in naturalness, robustness, and speaker similarity (i.e. matches the original voice), reportedly achieving “human parity” on these metrics. It can generate highly natural speech, even for challenging or repetitive text, directly in the voice of an unseen speaker using just a short prompt.

### Video

* **Video-ChatGPT:** (ACL 2024) Video-ChatGPT combines a video encoder with an LLM to enable natural dialogue about video content. Trained on 100,000 annotated video-instruction pairs (via a semi-automated pipeline), Video-ChatGPT can **answer questions and hold conversations about videos** with strong detail. It represents a move from image-based vision-chat models to full video comprehension, with quantitative eval metrics for video dialog introduced. (Code and dataset are published.)
* **Video-XL:** BAAI’s Video-XL (submitted Sept 2024) targets *extra-long* (hour-scale) video understanding. It introduces a “Visual Summarization Token” (VST) per video interval to compress thousands of frames while retaining key info. Video-XL uses curriculum and dynamic compression to train on combined short and synthetic data. Impressively, it outperforms prior models on long-video benchmarks, with only 1/16th of the frames (yet preserving details) and can process thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU. This enables ultra-long video Q\&A and summarization tasks previously infeasible.
* **Valley-2:** Alibaba Damo’s Valley 2 (Jan 2025) is an e-commerce–focused multimodal LLM. It uses a Qwen2.5 LLM backbone with a SigLIP-384 image encoder, plus novel architectural blocks (a large visual vocabulary, ConvAdapters, and the “Eagle” module) to flexibly handle diverse inputs. Valley-2 was trained in stages (text-vision alignment, knowledge learning, instruction fine-tune with chain-of-thought) on a mix of product and short-video data. It achieves **top results** on multimodal benchmarks (MMBench, MMStar, MathVista) and outperforms peers of similar size on an e-commerce VQA test. Alibaba plans to extend it with audio/video modalities, indicating a vision for a unified large multimodal model.

# Implementation Roadmap

* **Phase 1 – Setup & Data (0–2 mo):** Prepare the environment and assemble datasets for each modality. Tasks include setting up compute (GPU/TPU cluster), implementing data ingestion pipelines (scripts to download and preprocess image, text, audio, video corpora), and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) of each dataset. *Dependencies:* Data collection must precede modeling. *Milestones:* Quick wins include successfully loading and visualizing sample images, transcribing a small audio sample with Whisper, and extracting keyframes from video. Use this phase to finalize the project scaffold and ensure all teams have the same baseline environment.
* **Phase 2 – Unimodal Baselines (3–6 mo):** Develop and train baseline models independently for each modality. For vision, fine-tune or adapt pretrained models like DINOv2 or EVA-02 on image tasks. For language, fine-tune LLaMA-2/3 or Mistral on domain-relevant text tasks. For audio, adapt Whisper-v3 for ASR tasks and VALL-E 2 for TTS/speech-cloning. For video, train a vision+temporal model (e.g. TimeSformer or the Video-XL approach) on labeled action/QA data. Track performance on standard benchmarks (ImageNet, GLUE or LLM benchmarks, Librispeech/TTS metrics, video QA). *Dependencies:* Requires cleaned data and working notebooks from Phase 1. *Milestones:* A “small” multimodal demo (e.g. image captioning using separate vision & LLM) can be a quick win. Ensure each model can train end-to-end (with logs saved in `experiments/`).
* **Phase 3 – Early Multimodal Fusion (6–9 mo):** Combine modalities using simple fusion techniques. For example, train a CLIP-style model or SigLIP for image–text alignment; experiment with audio tokens fed into the LLM (e.g. use AudioPaLM embeddings to text). Implement baseline multimodal tasks: image captioning, VQA, speech-to-text pipelines, and video Q\&A using the models from Phase 2. Use smaller compute cluster setups (few GPUs) initially. Identify capacity bottlenecks (GPU memory/time). *Dependencies:* Completion of unimodal models; a shared multimodal dataset or aligned data (e.g. image-caption pairs, video transcripts). *Milestones:* Achieve working prototypes: e.g. an image+question → answer system, or a short video + chat. Measure performance (e.g. BLEU/CIDEr for captions, ASR WER, VQA accuracy).
* **Phase 4 – Joint Multimodal Training (9–12 mo):** Build the full integrated system. This may involve training or fine-tuning a single large model on multimodal inputs (e.g. a vision+language LLM like LLaVA or InternVL). Key tasks: design the final model architecture (how to fuse modalities within the LLM), implement any special modules (e.g. custom tokenization for images/audio, Fusion Adapter layers), and train on combined datasets. This phase is compute-intensive: use large-scale infrastructure (e.g. DGX cluster or cloud TPU pods). Also develop training pipelines with distributed data/model parallelism (e.g. DeepSpeed or Megatron). *Dependencies:* Working fusion prototypes; finalized design choices. *Milestones:* A unified model that can jointly reason across image/video/audio and text. Preliminary evaluation on integrated tasks (e.g. visual dialog with audio cues). Aim for a stable training run on a reduced subset before scaling up.
* **Phase 5 – Evaluation & Deployment (12–15 mo):** Rigorously evaluate the system on all target tasks and benchmarks (multimodal QA, retrieval, generation, etc.). Perform ablations to identify weaknesses. Optimize the model for inference: experiment with quantization or distillation if needed for deployment. Set up inference demos or APIs. Finalize documentation. *Dependencies:* Fully trained model from Phase 4. *Milestones:* Publish results on benchmarks, demonstrate end-to-end capabilities (e.g. a video-chatbot demo), and complete all project documentation.

**Timeline & Effort Estimates:** Roughly, each phase spans \~3 months (4–6 engineer-months), though phases can overlap (e.g. start Phase 3 once initial baselines from Phase 2 appear stable). *Quick wins* include training small-scale models (e.g. fine-tuning off-the-shelf Vision/LLM on a single GPU in weeks) and achieving baseline multimodal outputs. *Long-term research tasks* involve designing novel architectures (e.g. large MLLM training with custom modules), which may require extensive iteration.

**Hardware Recommendations:** Develop on GPUs with sufficient memory and multi-GPU support. For early notebooks and small models, high-end consumer GPUs (e.g. NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090 with 24GB) suffice. For large-scale training, use data-center GPUs (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100 with 40–80GB VRAM) in multi-GPU nodes (DGX or cloud instances) with NVLink or InfiniBand interconnect. Professional GPUs (RTX 6000 Ada 48GB) are recommended for very large vision models or high-res inputs. Multi-GPU servers with PCIe lanes (Xeon or Threadripper platforms) are ideal for data throughput. In sum, plan for a mix of a few workstation GPUs for prototyping and a GPU cluster (8+ GPUs) for heavy training. Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) with specialized AI VM instances can also be used for scale-out. Robust storage (SSD/NVMe) and cluster orchestration (Kubernetes, SLURM) are advisable for logging experiments and managing data.

**Dependencies & Quick Wins:** Data cleaning and preprocessing must precede any training (vision/text/audio). Early tests should fine-tune pretrained models rather than train from scratch. For example, fine-tuning an open LLM or vision model on a small curated dataset can validate the pipeline quickly. Long-term milestones (like training a giant multimodal model) will build on these foundations. Each phase naturally depends on the previous: e.g. you cannot fuse modalities until unimodal models work. By structuring work in notebooks and directories (as above), dependencies are explicit and code becomes reusable.

**Summary:** This roadmap and code scaffold supports a comprehensive multimodal AI research project: starting from data, building unimodal models, moving to multimodal integration, and culminating in a unified system. Each step is documented in dedicated notebooks for reproducibility. The literature review highlights state-of-art models to draw on for components (e.g. use DINOv2 for vision encoders, LLaMA3 or Mistral for text, Whisper/MusicLM for audio, Video-XL or InternVL for video). Hardware planning ensures we can train and test models at scale. With phased milestones and clear quick-win deliverables, this plan balances immediate results with ambitious research goals.

**Sources:** State-of-art model details and benchmarks are from recent publications and announcements.
